My personal aoc2024 hacks, going to try to comment them a bit if anyone is ever curious, but outside of comments I prefer to leave the solutions as-is from the moment part 2 is solved since I'm not trying to obscure the raw hacks that they are.

Mostly been doing these with Node.JS since js has is fast enough and has all needed components to solve these quickly.
